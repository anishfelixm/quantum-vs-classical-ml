The paper presents a comprehensive overview of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), outlining its fundamental principles, algorithmic foundations, and practical challenges. A particular emphasis is placed on experimental comparisons between classical machine learning methods and their quantum counterparts, with a focus on Support Vector Machines (SVMs).

The authors introduce QML as an interdisciplinary field that combines quantum computing with machine learning to potentially improve computational efficiency and model performance. By leveraging quantum phenomena such as superposition and parallelism, QML aims to address complex learning tasks that are difficult for classical algorithms. The paper discusses the inherent challenges of integrating classical and quantum computing paradigms and highlights Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs) as a promising approach capable of outperforming classical SVMs on high-dimensional and complex datasets.

The primary motivation of the study is to bridge the gap between classical machine learning and emerging quantum techniques. The authors systematically examine whether quantum algorithms can provide measurable speedups or performance improvements over classical approaches. To this end, experimental evaluations are conducted to compare classical SVM and QSVM models across multiple datasets, with research questions centered on hybrid classical–quantum integration, computational efficiency, and current limitations of quantum learning methods.

A detailed literature survey is presented, based on a systematic review that identified 84 relevant publications from an initial pool of 5,079 articles. This analysis highlights key milestones in quantum computing, including Shor’s factorization algorithm and Google’s demonstration of quantum supremacy. The review also indicates that the United States and China are the leading contributors to QML research, together accounting for nearly half of the published work in this area.

The paper further introduces core QML concepts, explaining the role of qubits and quantum registers in enabling parallel information representation. Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) are discussed as a central framework for optimization and classification tasks, with Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) presented as a specialized subclass of variational quantum algorithms.

In terms of methodology, QML algorithms are categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning paradigms. Among these, QSVM is highlighted as a key supervised learning algorithm that utilizes quantum processors for kernel estimation and classification. The potential applications of QML span diverse domains, including computer vision, medical imaging, and drug discovery.

The paper provides a detailed explanation of QSVM, noting its ability to compute kernels directly in quantum feature spaces and efficiently explore high-dimensional representations. QSVM supports binary and multi-class classification tasks, as well as clustering, and demonstrates advantages over classical methods in handling complex data distributions.

Despite these advantages, the authors emphasize several challenges limiting the practical deployment of QML. Current approaches largely adapt classical algorithms to quantum settings, reflecting the absence of a unified theoretical framework. Moreover, noise in quantum circuits, limited qubit availability, and the lack of effective error-correction mechanisms significantly affect learning performance.

The study also discusses broader advantages and limitations of QML. While quantum computing offers the potential for speedups and improved learning from intricate data structures, practical concerns such as high costs, hardware fragility, and interpretability challenges remain significant barriers. Security implications, particularly the potential impact of quantum computing on cryptographic systems, are also briefly addressed.

For empirical evaluation, the authors compare QSVM and classical SVM using three benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: Breast Cancer Wisconsin, Ionosphere, and Spam Base. These datasets vary in size and feature dimensionality and cover classification tasks ranging from medical diagnosis to spam detection. Experiments are conducted using the Qiskit Aqua framework, with performance evaluated through 10-fold cross-validation to ensure a fair and consistent comparison between classical and quantum models.
