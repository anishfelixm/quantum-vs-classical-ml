The paper presents a quantum-enhanced approach to image classification based on the Quantum k-Nearest Neighbor (QKNN) algorithm, demonstrating that quantum parallelism can significantly reduce computational complexity while maintaining classification accuracy comparable to classical KNN methods.

Quantum Machine Learning for Image Classification
Proposes a quantum image classification framework based on the Quantum k-Nearest Neighbor (QKNN) algorithm.
Aims to address the high computational cost of classical KNN, particularly for large-scale and high-dimensional image datasets.

Quantum KNN-Based Architecture
Employs a hybrid classical–quantum pipeline where image feature extraction is performed classically.
Image features (color and texture descriptors) are encoded into quantum superposition states using amplitude encoding
Quantum circuits are used to compute similarity between test and training images in parallel.

Methodology and Algorithm Design
Distance between images is computed using a controlled-swap (SWAP test) quantum circuit.
Similarity values are stored using quantum amplitude estimation.
A quantum minimum search algorithm (Dürr’s algorithm) identifies the k nearest neighbors with reduced search complexity.
Final classification is obtained via a single quantum measurement and majority voting.

Datasets and Experimental Evaluation
Evaluated on two natural image datasets:
Graz-01 (833 images, 2 classes: bikes and persons)
Caltech-101 (2921 images across 9 selected classes)
Feature vectors consist of combined color and texture descriptors with a dimensionality of 80.

Performance and Complexity Analysis
Achieved a maximum classification accuracy of 83.1% on Graz-01 and 78% on Caltech-101, comparable to classical methods.
Demonstrates a theoretical complexity of O(√kM) for similarity search, offering a quadratic speedup over classical KNN search.
Similarity computation complexity is reduced from O(M) (classical) to O(1) (quantum), assuming efficient state preparation.

Comparison with Classical Approaches
Maintains classification accuracy close to classical KNN-based methods while significantly improving computational efficiency.
Particularly advantageous for large datasets where classical KNN becomes computationally prohibitive.

Challenges and Future Directions
Assumes efficient quantum state preparation, which remains a practical bottleneck on current hardware.
Experiments are simulation-based, with no deployment on real quantum devices.
Future work includes quantum-based feature extraction, improved accuracy through advanced descriptors, and validation on larger image datasets.
