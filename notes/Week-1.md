# Week 1 – Project Setup & Planning

## Environment Setup
- Created conda environment `qmlstudy` with Python 3.11
- Installed PyTorch, torchvision
- Installed PennyLane, Qiskit
- Installed scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Research Focus
- Comparative analysis of Quantum ML vs Classical ML
- Focus on low-data image classification
- Initial datasets planned:
  - MNIST
  - BreastMNIST
  - PlantVillage

## Next Steps
- Dataset preprocessing pipelines
- Classical baseline models (CNN, SVM)
- Quantum feature maps and variational circuits



To-do:
1. Deep read 3 QML foundational papers (0 / 5)
2. Store papers in repo
3. Prepare foundational QML summary 1 page (intro, methodology, results, goals) 300 words summary each paper
4. Note datasets, and metrics
3. Choose 6 Applied QML experiments papers

Done:
1. Set-up github repo
2. Set-up packages and requirements
3. Set-up Mendeley
4. Choose 10 foundational QML papers
5. Choose the ones to read
