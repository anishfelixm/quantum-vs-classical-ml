# Week 1 – Project Setup & Planning

## Environment Setup
- Created conda environment `qmlstudy` with Python 3.11
- Installed PyTorch, torchvision
- Installed PennyLane, Qiskit
- Installed scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Research Focus
- Comparative analysis of Quantum ML vs Classical ML
- Focus on low-data image classification
- Initial datasets planned:
  - MNIST
  - BreastMNIST
  - PlantVillage

## Next Steps
- Dataset preprocessing pipelines
- Classical baseline models (CNN, SVM)
- Quantum feature maps and variational circuits



To-do:
1. Note datasets, and metrics
