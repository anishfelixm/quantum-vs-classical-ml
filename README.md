### Primary Research question

> How do Quantum Machine Learning models compare to classical mmachine learing models in terms of accuracy, generalization and efficiency when trained on small-scale image data-sets?


### Abstract

This repository contains the code, datasets, and results for our study comparing Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and Classical Machine Learning (CML) models for image classification under low-data conditions.
We evaluate both approaches across MNIST, BreastMNIST, and PlantVillage datasets, focusing on performance, noise robustness, and generalization
